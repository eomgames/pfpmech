# pfpmech

This is an example how you can load a PFP Mech into threejs. Not a complete project.

Here is a youtube video of this being used: https://youtu.be/3g9immY7nSk

# Lighting

There are two hrd files in the project, they are from PolyHaven.com, you can download new ones from there and replace them in the project. You can also take them out and use your own lighting. I'm still new to lighing in threejs, I think the colors are washed out and I'm not sure how to fix it.

My main project is using Babylon.js, I'm showing threejs some love, it's inscribed so that's why I'm using it here.
